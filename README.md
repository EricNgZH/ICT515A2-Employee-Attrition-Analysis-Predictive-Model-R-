# ICT515A2 Employee Attrition Analysis Predictive Model (R)

This project investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the "Great Resignation" on employee attrition and developed a machine learning model to predict employee churn. 

The project involved the following steps:
1. Exploratory data analysis: To understand the data and identify patterns and trends.
2. Data cleaning and encoding: To prepare the data for machine learning analysis.
3. Building and evaluating different algorithm models: To identify the best performing model for predicting employee churn.
4. Analyzing selected model findings: To understand which factors are most important in predicting employee churn.

The project findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic and the "Great Resignation" have had a significant impact on employee attrition, with many employees voluntarily leaving their jobs during this period. The machine learning model developed in this project can be used to identify employees who are at risk of churning, so that organizations can take proactive steps to retain their talent.
